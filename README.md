# BasicCalculator
Calculator app for simple arithmetic built from scratch using html, css, and javascript. I built
this webpage calculator to apply concepts I have learned early on in my web dev journey.

(Things learned while working on project):
- Evaluating an equation by parsing through the given string and separating operations by
  precedence.
- Printing button contents to screen while avoiding a screen overflow.
- Styling and organizing html elements to represent a calculator visually.

(Things I could improve):
- I could add more button input validation, for better user experience .
- I could refactor some of the functions, for better readability.
